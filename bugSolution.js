// Ensure that the Tailwind directives are correctly included in your CSS file or in your configuration.
// If you're using a CSS framework such as Bootstrap in conjunction with Tailwind, check for conflicting CSS rules
// that could be overriding the Tailwind hover styles. 
// A simple page refresh, hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R), clearing your browser cache or a rebuild of the project 
// might also help resolve unexpected styling behaviour.
