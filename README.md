# Tailwind CSS Hover State Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS hover states are not applying correctly.  The issue occurs despite seemingly correct implementation of the Tailwind classes.

## Bug Description

The `hover:bg-blue-700` class is not changing the background color on hover.  The element remains red, even when the mouse is over it.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Start a local development server (e.g., using Vite).
4. Observe that hovering over the element does not change the background color.

## Solution

The solution involves verifying that the correct Tailwind directives are included within the project and also checking that there are no conflicting CSS rules.  Sometimes a simple refresh or rebuild of the project may be enough to clear any unexpected caching issues.
